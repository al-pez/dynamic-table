# dynamic-table

Allows to add/remove columns on runtime without the need of reloading views/collections.

### Install

Choose your flavour

* `npm install angular-dynamic-table`
* `bower install dynamic-table`
    
and add dynamic-table.js (or .min version) to your index.html

### Demo

A demo application is available [here](https://github.com/al-pez/dynamic-table/tree/master/sample), with all the necesary to run a small sample of _dynamic-table_ functionality. Feel free to play with it.
    
### Dependencies

Note that dynamic-table depends on the following modules and therefore these must be added to the project, as well as their corresponding `<script>`/`<link>` tags before `dynamic-table`'s one:

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [UI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (CSS & fonts)
