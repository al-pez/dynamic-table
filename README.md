# dynamic-table

Dynamic table component for [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) applications.
Allows to add/remove columns on runtime without the need of reloading views/collections.

## Install

* `npm install angular-dynamic-table`

### OR

* `bower install dynamic-table`
    
and add dynamic-table.js (or minified) to your index.html
    
### Dependencies

Note that dynamic-table depends on the following modules and therefore these will need to be added to the project, as well as their corresponding `<script>`/`<link>` tags before `dynamic-table`'s one:

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [UI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (CSS & fonts)
